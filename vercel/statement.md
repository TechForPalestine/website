# Vercel's Alignment with Genocide

Vercel CEO Guillermo Rauch recently [posted a selfie](https://x.com/rauchg/status/1972669025525158031) with indicted war criminal Benjamin Netanyahu. In it, he wished "greatness for Israel".

Israel has spent 2 years committing a genocide in Gaza, and for over 75 years has been violently occupying Palestine, running an apartheid system in which Palestinians are denied basic human rights, and subjecting Palestinians to extreme violence including murder and rape. Israel evicts Palestinians from their homes, burns down their homes and villages, and bombs them, killing hundreds and thousands a year before the genocide started in 2023. Since then, they have killed at least 60,000 people, and more likely 200,000, and destroyed over 80% of Gaza, previously home to 2M people.

Rauch's selfie with Netanyahu aligned him and Vercel with Israel's genocide. Which means supporting Vercel is now support for genocide.

Despite Vercel's support for genocide, the following speakers are scheduled to speak at Vercel's signature conferences: Next.js Conf, and Vercel Ship AI, on October 22nd and 23rd.

There is a massive worldwide movement against complicity in Israel's genocide, including in tech. We reached out to the speakers of the conference and the companies they represented, asking them to pull out, and they chose not to. Here they are.
