wtrmln.info is a digital hub that connects consumers with businesses that are made in Palestine, owned by Palestinians, or donating to the Palestinian community. It goes beyond promoting BDS-safe businesses by empowering individuals to directly support the Palestinian economy through “buycotting”—choosing to purchase goods for ethical and political impact.
