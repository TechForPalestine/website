The Mapping Genocide Project is a radical digital tool to provide transparency,
accountability and direct action. Our platform is intended to be an instrument
for organizers, researchers, and the global public, presenting a clear,
interactive map of the locations, operations, and products of the weapons
dealers supplying genocidal regimes.

The map transcends mere information dissemination; it is designed to be a tool
for strategic planning, empowering coalitions and organizers to orchestrate
effective campaigns. As seen in recent events, such as the shutdown of a St.
Charles Missouri Boeing facility (which manufactures jets and bombs for israel)
by a coalition of organizers from Chicago, St. Louis, and Kansas City, the need
for accessible and actionable intelligence is urgent. The project currently
exclusively focuses on the Top 5 Genocide Suppliers providing weapons to the
israeli regime.
