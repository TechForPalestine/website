We analyze newspapers and media outlets from key markets, including the USA, Canada, the UK, and Germany, to provide quantitative evidence of the persistent bias against Palestine. We provide customizable reports on the keywords used (or not used) in the coverage of the Gaza genocide. By analyzing these metrics, we reveal the biases present in Western media reporting.
