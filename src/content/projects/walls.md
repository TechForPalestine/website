title: "Walls"
---

We put art where it doesn't belong: an AR-based platform, allowing you to experience art exhibitions in your own home. Built in Berlin - where the government has cut off 100s of artists from exhibiting due to Pro-Palestinian stances. 
Walls is carefully curated, and our GTM is a free audio-tool (for tours/guides) for small-to-medium sized art galleries and museums.
