title: "The Anti-War Initiative"
---

We want to create a one-stop website that documents ties of academics, faculty, researchers and administrators on campuses to militarism broadly and in specific cases as well. In this way then, students and other faculty can make choices of what technologies to develop, who to work with and how to ethically regulate research and academic work. We will be launching the website with a novel report on Princeton's ties to militarism. MIT groups have agreed to contribute their reports. We will then do outreach to get more universities to do similar research.
