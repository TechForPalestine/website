A platform to submit evidence anonymously regarding institutional and corporate
complicity in genocide. The SI4J team (Cambridge University Social Innovation
Alumni + associated professionals) will collate, write up, and present the
evidence on the open platform, available for local lawyers to hold the
institutions/brands accountable or even build a court case.
