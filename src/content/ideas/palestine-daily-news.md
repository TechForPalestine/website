### Palestine daily news

Media bias is out of control in America and the west, and news in America is fully pro-Israel. As a result, we should look for other avenues to ensure that the Palestinian struggle is top of mind.

Build a team to both publish daily news from international media (perhaps leveraging [FMEPâ€™s weekly news resources](https://fmep.org/resource/top-news-analysis-on-israel-palestine-january-24-31-2025/)), touching on Palestine and related issues, as well as disseminated the news by printing it out and handing out fliers at large foot traffic areas, such as metro/subway stations, football games, malls, etc.
