### Analyze bias on Hacker News

Hacker News is a unique and important watering hole for the tech industry. It appears to many of us that Hacker News is biased, especially it allowing Israel to flag almost any post that is about the genocide, occupation, or the role of Israel and Israeli tech within it.

Either use the HN API, or speak to the HN moderators (if theyâ€™re cooperative) to analyse bias on HN, including locating the presence of voting rings on comments and stories if present. Determine if HN policies (eg when to allow user flagging to kill stories) is appropriate, and suggest whether HN moderation are complicit deliberately or accidentally. Suggest new policies if appropriate, based on the results.
