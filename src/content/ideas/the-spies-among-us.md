### The Spies among us

Former Israeli soldiers and in particular Unit 8200 members work throughout tech, and form an important part of Israel influence networks. In numerous cases, there is evidence of Israeli employees at Big Tech using their influence to change policy (esp around free speech), to suppress anti-genocide viewpoints, to access systems which they should not be able to access to spy on other employees and the american public.

If they were Russian, we would call them spies. Many are literally spying, and should be literally called spies.

Make clear to the public and to the tech sector in particular, that former IDF members should not be in any positions which involve policy or user data. Any company which houses user data is not safe (that is, all companies) and any companies who trust their data to any Israeli companies or companies with IDF or Unit 8200 presence themselves should not be trusted.
