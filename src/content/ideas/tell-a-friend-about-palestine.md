### Tell a friend about Palestine

Increasingly, our ability to advocate on social media is constrained. But this might actually be good. Social media is not a great way for ordinary non-influencers to have their message heard â€” with short messages and limited reach, we cannot educate at the level needed to convert individuals to the Palestinian cause.

Instead, we could build a movement to tell a friend about Palestine, over coffee, lunch, a drink, etc. By having a one-on-one conversation where we can get into the details of the apartheid, the Nakba, the Israeli genocide, etc, we actually have a much greater opportunity to bring people over to our cause.

This project would build materials and education for those who want to try this, collecting best practices and running teach-ins to grow the movement.

Potential subprojects / variations:

* Tell your parents about Palestine
* Tell your group chats about Palestine
* Tell your colleagues about Palestine
