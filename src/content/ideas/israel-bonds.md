### Israel bonds

[Israel bonds](https://littlesis.org/news/u-s-state-and-local-treasuries-hold-at-least-1-6-billion-in-israel-bonds/) are a tool of raising money for Israel, having sold more than \$52B in bonds since 1952. Forcing divestment from these bonds would remove \$5-10B from the treasury, which is 1-2% of Israelâ€™s GDP. Investigate who holds bonds and come up with different approaches to address divestment.
