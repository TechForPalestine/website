### Track laundered misinformation

Israel constantly generates anti-Palestinian hasbara, which is “laundered” through an echo chamber of Israeli government-aligned organizations. This laundering turns fake propaganda into part of a mainstream narrative in which "everybody knows" or it is “widely contended” or a “longstanding concern”, which is then cited by media and foreign goverments. For example. Israel is the entirely unacknowledged source behind hundreds/thousands of Google hits linking UNRWA and Al Haq to US-designated Foreign Terrorist Organizations. We want to track each piece of misinformation, and expose its path from the Israeli goverment, through Israeli NGOs and partner orgs, into international media.
