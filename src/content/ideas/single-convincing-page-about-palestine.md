### Single convincing page about Palestine

Does a single page exist that someone unfamiliar with Palestine could use to immediately become radicalized? Many wonderful resources such a decolonizepalestine or Visualizing Palestine exist, but is there currently a page that is perfectly concise and convincing that in a few minutes someone could become convinced. The [BDS Brief Background](https://bdsmovement.net/colonialism-and-apartheid/summary) is good at it. Graphics involving the destroyed rubble of Gaza, or Israeli settler or soldier violence and murder, perhaps corpses juxtaposed against a vibrant Gaza.

This involves significant experimentation, research and testing using individuals. The impact of this piece is something that could be effectively used throughout the movement.
