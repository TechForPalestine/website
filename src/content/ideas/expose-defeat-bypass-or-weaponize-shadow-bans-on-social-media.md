### Expose, defeat, bypass, or weaponize shadow bans on social media

There is well-documented algorithmic and policy bias against Palestinian content on social media. It is effective, and important to address. There are many different and innovative approaches that could be used to address it, such as:

* Analyzing and documenting shadow ban behaviour on different platforms
* Evidencing and exposing the shadow ban on media
* Create how-to guides for influencers/content creators to avoid shadow bans and other restrictions
* Building similar tools to those that Israel uses to suppress Palestine, such as the Israeli “Cyber Defense Unit” or [other tools](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1WrvvBtiyR0skvAIOa54XRvR2XOEKyckBdjqaSvdTX5M/edit?pli=1#slide=id.g2fa53d06a1a_0_27), to attack pro-Israel or pro-genocide content
* Making existing tools for addressing digital rights violations (such as [https://7or.7amleh.org/](https://7or.7amleh.org/)) more well-known

We don’t believe there is an easy and obvious answer here, so multiple different and experimentation approaches by different groups are welcomed.
