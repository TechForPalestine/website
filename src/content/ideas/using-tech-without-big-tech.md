### Using tech without Big Tech

Big Tech — in particular AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure — is particularly complicit in the genocide. They also collaborate with the Israeli state and the IDF, making it a huge risk to even work with them. They’re also massively expensive. But what options do ethical companies have?

That’s what we’d like you to find it. By looking at new technologies, open source projects, ethical hosting providers, we’d like you to put together advise to startups and technical companies on how they can build products without using Big Tech that has directly enabled the genocide.
