### Find Israeli subprocessors

Many companies are required to list their subprocessors - the companies to whom they provide some amount of customer data for some service, such as analytics. Companies who use Israeli subprocessors open themselves up to significant liability due to the well-known connection between Israeli companies and the military (that is, you can expect they are sharing this information), as demonstrated by Israel’s pager attack and the WhatsApp data alleged to be used in Lavender. This is a liability to the companies, their partners, and their investors.

By analyzing published subprocessor lists (usually found in a company’s privacy policy), you can make known to customers whether their data (and their customers’ data) is at risk. Perhaps a social media account that shares when any company starts sending data to Israel.
