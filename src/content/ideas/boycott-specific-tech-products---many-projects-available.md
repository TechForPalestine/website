### Boycott specific (tech) products - many projects available

Boycott lists contain thousands of products to be boycotted - Israel has 7000 startups alone, and an economic and cultural boycott will take significant effort. We want to build teams focused on supporting boycotts on individual products, providing guides, content, technical tools, technical support and migration assistance, consulting, and marketing, to help people move off boycotted products. Examples include projects to move off each of Wix, Deel, Whatspp, and Google. There are thousands of products to be moved off, and expertise in the relevant product domain is especially useful.

In particular, Wix has been repeatedly identified as a good target, eg by [https://www.boycottwix.org/](https://www.boycottwix.org/). Automation, tools, content and advocacy around this would be useful.

Current specific company Boycotting / migration projects include: WhatsApp, Spotify, Instagram, and Gmail.
