### Cover the US in Keffiyehs

The Keffiyeh is a visible symbol of Palestinian liberation. Wearing it, especially in cities in the West, shows not just solidarity with Palestine, but solidarity with other people who support Palestinian liberation.

Sadly, Keffiyehs are not that easy to come by for a casual shopper. If you go looking you can find one from Hirbawi online, or low quality ones on Amazon. But if you don’t specifically go looking online, you probably won’t come across one.

Our goal here would be to ensure that Keffiyeh’s are available everywhere, whether that means setting up independent street vendors at tourist areas or markets, working to distribute through bodegas / corner stores, or connecting to thrift stores, counter-culture stores, or even high-end boutiques.

Ideally you would be setting up a network of partners through dozens of cities and metro areas who can do the work on the ground, and you would work to connect them to suppliers.
