### Built with Israel

Many companies and NGOs unwittingly use tools created by Israel or pro-Israel companies, which damages their security and safety stands, as well as their user data. Make a tool which can analyze a website and make recommendations to remove Wix, Elementor, Stripe, Google Cloud, and many other tools with less dangerous alternatives. Similar to the app “[builtwith](https://builtwith.com/)”, and using data from [The Wall](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/the-wall-boycott-assistan/kocebhffdnlgdahkbfeopdokcoikipam?hl=en) extension, [Boycat](https://www.boycat.io/), or [IsraeliTechAlternatives](https://www.israelitechalternatives.com/).
