### Come up with strategies to engage the right wing

Almost all campaigners for Palestine within the US are left-wing, approaching Palestine from a perspective of liberation and anti-colonialism.

However, whether we love it or hate it, in the US, the right wing is in charge now, and will be for some amount of time between 4 years and forever. We need to develop new strategies and message to reach the right wing to bring them along with our goals. The most likely strategy is to educate them on how Hasbara / Israeli control has infiltrated their movement or US congress.

Note that this is a particularly delicate and tricky move as the right wing has historically had an anti-semitism problem, and the distinction between anti-zionism and anti-semitism is already a tricky subject for mainstream audiences. We want to ensure that this messaging does not turn into anti-semitic hatred that splashes back on all Jewish people (partially because Zionists will be more than happy to leverage that).
