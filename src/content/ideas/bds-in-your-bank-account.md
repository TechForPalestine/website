### BDS in your bank account

Build an app that can apply BDS to your bank account. Run all your bank and credit card purchases through a BDS filter, and let the user know where they should stop going and what they should stop buying.

A good complement to [Boycat](https://boycat.io/), [The Wall](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/the-wall-boycott-assistan/kocebhffdnlgdahkbfeopdokcoikipam?hl=en), and [Israeli Tech Alternatives](israelitechalternatives.com) (with which you can probably share data).
