### Understanding Lavender

The Lavender AI (alongside Gospel and Where’s Daddy) are horrific uses of AI that allowed Israel to automate the genocide. Put together a set of educational content, bringing in appropriate leaders and experts, about lavender that explains what happened, who is culpable, why this use of AI is unethical, explain the nuances of International Humanitarian Law and how Israel violated them, and make this accessible to educators, politicians, and lay people.

## Flag hate speech

One of Israel’s best tools for shutting down Palestinian content is abusing reporting tools on social media. At the same time, Israeli hate speech is allowed to run free. We should establish teams to monitor Israeli (and US) hate speech in order to report it and reduce it.
