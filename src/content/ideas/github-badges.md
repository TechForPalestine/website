We built [Github badges](https://github.com/TechForPalestine/badges) to advocate for Palestine in December. Alas, the initiative lost steam. We need someone who understands the open source ecosystem to pick this back up. Badges on GitHub repos may seem like a small thing, but this small act can allow workers to express their opinions in a low-key way, that raises the baseline of advocacy. By raising the baseline, workers can see solidarity around Palestine everywhere they code, leading to greater potential for advocacy in their companies. The badges need technical work, but more than anything they need sales and developer advocates / developer relations folks to work with individuals and coding or open source influencers to get these on their github, stackoverflow, dev.to, and other related sites.
