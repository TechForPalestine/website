### Automate digital privacy requests

The social media networks, in particular Meta, have enormous control on our lives because it is profitable for them to do so. The data they keep on us powers their advertising networks and profit centers, and there is little incentive for them to do otherwise.

Many countries have laws that can be leveraged to incentivize social media companies to keep less data. This hurts their profit centers and may accelerate a showdown between for example EU regulators and social media companies (in turn, providing national security reasons for non-US people to stop using US social media).

Investigate how to allow people to make requests of social media companies that are expensive for them to fulfill. Focus on Instagram/Meta, and build a site or tool that allows these requests to be made for very cheap.
