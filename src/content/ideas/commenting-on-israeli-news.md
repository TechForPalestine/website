### Commenting on Israeli news

Israeli news outlets are read by ordinary Israelis, and have commenting sections turned on. By commenting on their news, we can attempt to change public opinion in Israel, making it clear that each negative thing that happens is caused by Israelâ€™s apartheid. This project would be to setup a network of volunteers with some automation to enable and grow this.
