### Investigate and shut down illegal 501c3s

Much of Israelâ€™s illegal occupation is enabled by US-based charities with 501c3 status. These charities fund propaganda networks, build illegal settlements, and even give money to the IDF. Much of this is illegal under US and international law, with serious legal ramifications for the funders (eg under terrorism statutes). We want to build a project to investigate different avenues to shut down these attacks on Palestinians.
