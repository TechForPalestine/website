These are now dozens of reports that document how Israel influences and controls different parts of the US systems of power: in [film](https://www.mintpressnews.com/wikileaks-sony-hack-reveals-hollywoods-hand-in-repairing-israels-broken-image/205176/), [tech](https://www.leefang.com/p/inside-the-pro-israel-information), [billionaires](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2024/05/16/business-leaders-chat-group-eric-adams-columbia-protesters/), Congress and politicians though AIPAC, tech through the ADL, universities like [UCLA](https://www.thenation.com/article/activism/israeli-american-council/), the media through CAMERA, as well as dozens of pro-Israel leaders in media, tech, etc. Collecting these stories into a single place will help tell the story about how and why Americans have been unable to speak up about the genocide, even when they have tried.
