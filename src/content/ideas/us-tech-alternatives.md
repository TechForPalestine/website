title: US tech alternatives

US tech is deeply complicit in the genocide, and companies like Meta, Microsoft, and Google have massive power across the world. Not only that, but US tech is deeply Zionist, with companies like Shopify, Figma, and Paypal having outwardly anti-Palestine leaders and/or policies, and a great number of US companies being infiltrated by Israeli spies from Unit 8200. In addition, US tech exports US policies, for example anyone declared to be a "terrorist" by the US is automatically a "terrorist" in US tech, or by working with the racist ADL on content policies.

Providing lists of alternatives, as well as migration guides, campaigns to move people off US tech, etc, will allow groups that are politically interested in being outside the American sphere of influence to abandon more US tech, lowering the influence of both the US and Israel worldwide.
