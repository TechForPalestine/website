### Ceasefire Resolution network

Most cities in America have ceasefire resolutions being worked on. However, in some cities they have been very successful due to a sophisticated approach taken by those leaders. We want you to find leaders putting together resolutions in cities, and connect them together. Learn what worked for cities that have passed resolutions, and use this to train and help organize those who have not yet passed resolutions, including building content and tools to support them.
