### Sales of Palestinian lands

Palestinian land for settlements are sold openly in the US and Canada, despite being a violation of international law. There are a variety of different options to shut these down, via protest (working with JVP perhaps), by investigating whether these violate 501c3 status of the hosts, etc. Because of additional recent scrutiny, these have gone somewhat undercover, so we will need initial investigation.
