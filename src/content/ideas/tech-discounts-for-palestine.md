### Tech discounts for Palestine

Many incubators and other organizations have partnerships with tech companies that provide discounts to their startups. Similarly, many tech organizations have discounts for nonprofits (often requiring them to be registered charities).

Build a program that works with tech companies to get discounts for T4P projects as well as for Palestinian startups. This is a great opportunity to advocate to tech companies, and spread the message about the apartheid, occupation, settlement, and the violence against Palestine from Israel.
