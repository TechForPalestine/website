Existing boycott apps like NoThanks, Boycat, Ethicly, and Disoccupied, have shared their [datasets of brands to boycott](https://github.com/TechForPalestine/boycott-israeli-consumer-goods-dataset) with Tech for Palestine. These brands can be used to build existing boycott apps, but they can also be brought to dozens of novel and highly effective uses. We need a team to enable that. Can we partner with grocery chains, restaurants, fast food chains, or hotels, to remove these brands from their purchasing? Perhaps these can feed into tariff policies for countries that support Palestine and sanction Israel, like the Maldives or Malaysia. Or turned into APIs to support new technical use cases not yet imagined.
