### Boycotting the NY Times (and other complicit news orgs)

The New York Times, alongside other complicit news organizations, repeatedly manufacture consent for, normalize, and downplay the attrocities that Israel commits on Palestine, with tactics such as using the passive voice, or even the “past exonerative tense”.

To enable the boycott, it is useful for people to still be able to access NYT articles, such as using archiving services such as archive.ph. Can we make an app or site that leverages this to make boycotts of media much more effective?
