### Damage Israeli startups

Israel cannot exist without its startups. The military → startup → big tech pipeline is a huge part of the entire Israeli economy (36% of the budget come from tech worker taxes), as well as the documented role that Israeli employees have in helping Big Tech content suppression and support of Big Tech participation in the genocide.

What can we do to damage Israeli startups? We must make them a bad investment, for financial, ethical, and other reasons. Can we place stories about their ethical lapses, or their leaders’ role in genocide or other crimes against humanity? Can we damage them financially, by damaging their sales process, supporting their rivals, down-ranking their SEO, applying for their jobs, etc? There are many creative opportunities to cause damage to the ecosystem, and we would support many projects in this vein.
