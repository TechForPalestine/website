    <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> August 5, 2025</p>

    <p class="mt-6">
      Welcome to the <strong>Tech for Palestine</strong> website and services. Tech for Palestine ("<strong
        >we</strong
      >", "<strong>us</strong>", or "<strong>our</strong>") is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization
      whose mission is <em
        >to harness technology and human innovation for a free and truly sovereign Palestine</em
      >. These Terms of Service (these "<strong>Terms</strong>") govern your access to and use of
      our website, our incubator application/portal, and any related services (collectively, the "<strong
        >Services</strong
      >").
    </p>

    <p class="mt-4">
      By accessing or using our Services, <strong>you agree to be bound by these Terms</strong> as well
      as our <a href="/privacy-policy" class="text-green-700 hover:text-green-800">Privacy Policy</a
      > (which is incorporated herein by reference). If you do not agree with any part of these Terms
      or our Privacy Policy, you must not use our Services.
    </p>

    <p class="mt-4">
      Please read these Terms carefully. They constitute a legally binding agreement between you
      (the user of our Services) and Tech for Palestine. Throughout these Terms, "you" may be
      referred to as the "<strong>User</strong>". If you are using the Services on behalf of an
      organization or entity, you represent that you have the authority to bind that organization to
      these Terms, in which case "you" refers to that entity as well.
    </p>

    <h2 class="mb-4 mt-8 text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900" id="acceptance-of-terms">
      1. Acceptance of Terms
    </h2>

    <p>
      By using our website or any Services, you indicate that you <strong>accept these Terms</strong
      > and agree to comply with them. This acceptance is effective as of the date you first access the
      Services. If you do not agree, you must not use or access the Services.
    </p>

    <p class="mt-4">
      We may also ask you to signify agreement to these Terms (and any additional terms) by clicking
      "Accept" or "Agree" (for example, when registering an account). Even if we do not do so, your
      continued use of the Services constitutes acceptance. These Terms apply whether you are a
      visitor browsing the public website or a registered user (such as an incubator participant or
      volunteer with an account).
    </p>

    <p class="mt-4">
      <strong>Supplemental terms:</strong> In certain cases, additional terms or guidelines may apply
      to specific features or activities. For example, if we run a specific program, event, or contest,
      there might be separate guidelines or agreements. Any supplemental terms will be disclosed to you
      in connection with the relevant Service and are hereby incorporated into these Terms by reference.
      In the event of a conflict between these Terms and any supplemental terms, the supplemental terms
      will prevail for the specific service they apply to.
    </p>

    <h2 class="mb-4 mt-8 text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900" id="eligibility">2. Eligibility</h2>

    <p>
      The Services are offered and available only to users who are at least <strong
        >13 years of age</strong
      >. By using the Services, you represent and warrant that you are <strong>13 or older</strong>. <strong
        >If you are under 13 years old, you are not permitted to use our Services.</strong
      >
    </p>

    <p class="mt-4">
      Furthermore, our Services (particularly volunteering opportunities and incubator programs) are
      generally intended for adults. If you are between 13 and 17 years of age, you may use the
      Services <strong>only with the involvement and consent of a parent or legal guardian</strong>.
      We reserve the right to request verifiable parental consent for any users under 18 if
      necessary.
    </p>

    <p class="mt-4">
      Users must also have the <strong>power to enter a binding contract</strong> with us and are not
      barred from doing so under any applicable laws. You affirm that you are either at least 18 years
      of age, or if you are 13-17, that you have obtained parental or guardian consent to use the Services
      and your parent/guardian agrees to these Terms on your behalf. If you do not meet these requirements,
      you must not access or use the Services.
    </p>

    <p class="mt-4">
      The Services are provided from the United States. If you access the Services from outside the
      U.S., you are responsible for ensuring your use is lawful in your jurisdiction and complying
      with local laws.

      3. User Accounts and Registration
    </h2>

    <p>
      <strong>3.1 Account Creation:</strong> Some parts of our Services (such as updating an incubator
      project or managing volunteer info) may require you to create an account and provide certain information.
      If you register an account, you agree to provide accurate, current, and complete information as
      requested (for example, your real name, valid email address, etc.). You also agree to update your
      information if it changes, so that we have up-to-date records.
    </p>

    <p class="mt-4">
      <strong>3.2 Account Security:</strong> You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality
      of your account login credentials. You must not share your password or account access with others.

      liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to safeguard your credentials or comply
      with this section.

      <strong>3.3 User Responsibilities:</strong> When you create an account or use our Services, you

        Services, and not impersonate any other person or entity or misrepresent your affiliation.
      </li>
      <li>
        You will not select or use a username that is offensive, obscene, or infringes someone's
        rights. We reserve the right to reclaim or ask you to change a username if we deem it
        inappropriate or if it violates someone's intellectual property or identity rights.
      </li>
      <li>
        All information you provide to us, whether during registration or in other contexts, must be
        truthful and lawful. You will not provide any information that is defamatory, obscene,
        fraudulent, or violates any law or regulation.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you provide personal data of others (for instance, adding a team member in a project
        application), you have obtained their consent to do so and to have their information used by
        us as described in our Privacy Policy.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p class="mt-4">
      We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your account (and refuse any current or future
      use of the Services) if we determine, in our sole discretion, that you have violated any
      provision of these Terms or that your account information is false, misleading, or
      out-of-date.

      4. Acceptable Use Policy
    </h2>

    <p>
      You agree to use our Services only for lawful purposes and in compliance with these Terms. <strong
        >You are solely responsible for your conduct</strong
      > and any data, text, files, information, or other content that you submit, upload, or transmit
      via the Services ("<strong>User Content</strong>", see Section 5 below). In using the
      Services, <strong>you agree not to</strong> engage in any of the following prohibited activities:
    </p>

    <ul class="mt-4 list-disc space-y-2 pl-6">
      <li>
        <strong>Illegal Activities:</strong> You will not use the Services for any purpose that violates
        any applicable law or regulation. This includes not engaging in or promoting any criminal activity,
        fraud, hacking, or trafficking of unlawful material.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Abusive or Harmful Conduct:</strong> You will not upload, post, or transmit any content
        that is advocating violence, or that is discriminatory, abusive, threatening, harassing, defamatory,
        vulgar, obscene, pornographic, or otherwise offensive. Hate speech, harassment, and harmful content
        have no place in our community.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Endangering Any Person:</strong> You will not stalk, intimidate, harm, or endanger another
        person via the Services. You will not expose or share another person's private personal information
        without their consent (no doxxing).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Security Violations:</strong> You will not attempt to probe, scan, or test the vulnerability
        of our systems or networks, or breach any security or authentication measures. Similarly, you
        agree not to interfere with or disrupt the integrity or performance of the Services (including
        by introducing viruses, worms, malware, or any other harmful code).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Unauthorized Access:</strong> You will not access or use any non-public areas of the
        Services, our computer systems, or the technical delivery systems of our providers. You will

      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Spam and Misuse:</strong> You will not use the Services to send unsolicited or bulk communications
        (spam), chain letters, or pyramid schemes. You will not use any automated means (such as bots,
        scrapers, or scripts) to access or collect data from the Services without our express permission
        (note: public search engine operators may use spiders for creating searchable indices, which
        is permitted).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Commercial or Political Use:</strong> You will not use the Services for commercial solicitation
        or advertising not approved by us, and you will not use it to promote political campaigns or
        candidates in a way that implies our endorsement (unless authorized as part of our initiatives).
        Our Services are for the support of our mission and community, not for unauthorized commercial
        purposes.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Impersonation and False Statements:</strong> You will not impersonate any person or entity,
        or falsely state or misrepresent yourself (including using another person's login or account).
        You will not falsely imply an affiliation with us or do anything that might mislead others as
        to your identity or the origin of any messages or content you send.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Disruption:</strong> You will not engage in any conduct that restricts or inhibits anyone's
        use or enjoyment of the Services, or which, as determined by us, may harm us or other users of
        the Services or expose them to liability.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p class="mt-4">
      These examples are not exhaustive. We reserve the right to determine, in our sole discretion,
      what conduct is inappropriate or prohibited on the Services. Violation of the above may result
      in <strong>immediate termination or suspension</strong> of your account or access to the Services,
      and may also expose you to civil or criminal penalties.

      5. User Content and Submissions
    </h2>

    <p>
      Our Services may allow you to submit or upload content in certain areas – for example, posting
      information about your project in our incubator portal, submitting application materials, or
      communicating on forums or discussion boards (if any). Any content that a user submits, posts,
      displays, or otherwise makes available on the Services is referred to as "<strong
        >User Content</strong
      >."
    </p>

    <p class="mt-4">
      <strong>5.1 Your Responsibility for User Content:</strong> You retain any intellectual property
      rights you hold in the User Content you provide. We do not claim ownership of your original content.
      However, by providing User Content to our Services, you <strong
        >grant us certain rights</strong
      > to use it as described below. You are solely responsible for all User Content you submit and
      the consequences of posting or providing it. You affirm, represent, and warrant that:
    </p>

    <ul class="mt-4 list-disc space-y-2 pl-6">
      <li>
        <strong>You own or have necessary rights:</strong> You have obtained all necessary permissions,
        rights, or licenses to submit the content and to grant the licenses to us under these Terms.
        If your content includes any personal data of others, you have their consent as required by law
        to share it with us.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>No violation of rights:</strong> Your User Content and our use of it as permitted by
        these Terms will not infringe or violate the intellectual property, privacy, publicity, or other
        rights of any third party, nor violate any law or regulation.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>No harmful content:</strong> Your content is not defamatory, obscene, pornographic, hateful,
        or otherwise violative of our Acceptable Use Policy (Section 4 above). It does not contain malicious
        code or anything that could damage the Services or another user's device.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p class="mt-4">
      <strong>5.2 License Grant to Tech for Palestine:</strong> By submitting or posting User Content,
      you hereby grant Tech for Palestine a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, fully paid-up, sublicensable
      (as needed to provide the Services, e.g. to our cloud hosting providers), and transferable license
      to use, reproduce, distribute, modify (for technical purposes, e.g. resizing an image), publicly
      display, and perform your User Content <strong
        >solely for the purpose of operating and providing the Services</strong
      > and fulfilling our mission. This license is only as broad as necessary for those purposes – for
      example, if you post a project description on a forum visible to other program participants, we
      have the right to display it to those users; if you upload a document for an application, we may
      copy it to review it and share it internally with our selection committee. Any use of your content
      for publicity or promotional purposes will require your separate opt-in consent.
    </p>

    <p class="mt-4">
      We will <em>not</em> use your User Content for commercial purposes unrelated to our nonprofit mission,
      and we <em>will not sell</em> your content to third parties. This license to your content ends
      when you delete the content from our Services, except to the extent it has been shared with others
      as part of the Service (who may have then stored it) or it was archived in our backups (in which
      case we will delete in accordance with our retention policies).
    </p>

    <p class="mt-4">
      <strong>5.3 No Compensation:</strong> Tech for Palestine is not obligated to provide you any compensation
      for your User Content or for our use of it. Any contribution of content you make is purely voluntary
      and, unless otherwise expressly agreed in writing, does not entitle you to any compensation or
      credit.
    </p>

    <p class="mt-4">
      <strong>5.4 Monitoring and Enforcement:</strong> We do not routinely pre-screen User Content, but
      we reserve the right (though not the obligation) to review, screen, or delete any User Content
      at any time and for any reason, including if we believe it violates these Terms. We may also monitor
      and record your interactions with the Services (in accordance with our Privacy Policy) for security,
      debugging, and improvement purposes.
    </p>

    <p class="mt-4">
      We have the right to remove or disable access to any User Content for any or no reason,
      including if we, in our discretion, consider it objectionable or in violation of these Terms.
      We may also take action against you or your account for violation of our rules (see Section 8
      on Termination).
    </p>

    <p class="mt-4">
      <strong>5.5 Backups:</strong> You are encouraged to keep backups of your own content. We are not
      responsible for lost or unrecoverable User Content. While we do periodic backups, we do not guarantee
      that any User Content can be retrieved if lost.
    </p>

    <p class="mt-4">
      <strong>5.6 Feedback:</strong> If you provide us with any suggestions, ideas, or feedback about
      the Services ("Feedback"), you agree that we can use and share such Feedback for any purpose without
      compensation to you.

      7. Third-Party Links and Services

    <p>
      Our Services may contain links to third-party websites, resources, or services that are <strong
        >not owned or controlled by Tech for Palestine</strong
      >. For example, our site might link to our social media pages, to news articles, to partner
      organization sites, or to donation/payment processing services. Additionally, parts of our
      Services might integrate or allow you to use third-party services (such as a map API, an
      embedded video player, etc.).
    </p>

    <p class="mt-4">
      <strong>7.1 No Endorsement or Control:</strong> These links and integrations are provided for your
      convenience or reference only. Tech for Palestine does not endorse, monitor, or have any control
      over third-party websites or services. We are <strong>not responsible</strong> for the content,
      privacy policies, terms, or practices of any third-party websites or services. When you leave our
      site or interact with a third-party feature, <strong

    <p class="mt-4">
      For example, if you click a link to an external news article, that external site's terms
      govern your use of it. If you donate through a third-party payment processor (like PayPal or a
      dedicated donation platform), you will be subject to that platform's terms and privacy policy.

    <p class="mt-4">
      <strong>7.2 Separate Terms:</strong> Any third-party software or service (for instance, a single
      sign-on via Google, or a scheduling app integration) that you use in connection with our Services
      may be subject to the third party's license or terms. You are responsible for complying with those
      terms in addition to ours.
    </p>

    <p class="mt-4">
      <strong>7.3 No Liability:</strong>
      <strong>You agree that Tech for Palestine will not be liable for any loss or damage</strong> of
      any sort relating to your dealings with third parties found on or through our Services. This includes
      any personal information you provide to third parties and any consequences that arise. Use third-party

      8. Termination and Suspension
    </h2>

    <p>
      <strong>8.1 By You:</strong> You may stop using our Services at any time. If you have an account,
      you can choose to delete or deactivate it by contacting us (or using any available self-service
      feature for account deletion, if provided). Terminating your account will typically mean we deactivate
      your login credentials and cease providing you the Services tied to that account.
    </p>

    <p class="mt-4">
      <strong>8.2 By Us:</strong> We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access to the Services
      (or certain features of the Services) at our sole discretion if we have reason to believe: (a)
      you have violated these Terms or any applicable law; (b) you create risk or possible legal exposure
      for us; (c) our provision of the Services to you is no longer commercially viable or feasible;
      or (d) for any other reason including prolonged inactivity. We will provide reasonable notice when
      feasible, except where immediate termination is necessary to prevent abuse, fraud, or risk to others.
      We also reserve the right to remove or modify the Services (or any part thereof) at any time, temporarily
      or permanently.
    </p>

    <p class="mt-4">
      For example, if you seriously or repeatedly violate our Acceptable Use Policy (Section 4), we
      may suspend or delete your account and prevent you from using the Services. If we terminate
      for a breach of these Terms, you are not entitled to any compensation or remedy.
    </p>

    <p class="mt-4">
      <strong>8.3 Effect of Termination:</strong> Upon termination of your access or account for any
      reason, your right to use the Services will immediately cease. We may irreversibly delete your
      User Content or other data associated with your account, in accordance with our Privacy Policy
      (except to the extent we are required or permitted to retain data for legal reasons). You should
      ensure that you have saved or backed up any information you wish to keep prior to closing your
      account. We will not be liable to you or any third party for termination of your access to the
      Services or deletion of your account or content.
    </p>

    <p class="mt-4">
      Even after termination, provisions of these Terms that by their nature should survive will
      remain in effect. This includes, without limitation: sections on Intellectual Property,
      Disclaimers, Limitation of Liability, Indemnification, Governing Law, and any other clauses
      that imply or state they survive termination.

    <p>
      <strong

      > You agree that your use of the Site, app, and our Services is at your <strong

      >. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we <strong>disclaim all warranties</strong> of any kind,
      whether express, implied, or statutory, in connection with the Services and your use thereof.
    </p>

    <p class="mt-4">
      This means that, while we strive to offer useful, reliable Services, we are making <strong
        >no guarantees</strong
      > that:
    </p>

    <ul class="mt-4 list-disc space-y-2 pl-6">
      <li>
        The Services will always be available, timely, secure, uninterrupted, or error-free. We do
        not warrant that any defects or errors will be corrected, or that our systems are free of
        viruses or other harmful components.
      </li>
      <li>
        The results of using the Services will meet your expectations or requirements. For example,
        we cannot promise that by submitting a project application you will be accepted into the
        incubator, or that volunteering through us will guarantee any particular outcome.
      </li>
      <li>
        Any information or content obtained through the Services will be accurate, complete, or
        reliable. While we attempt to keep information up-to-date, there may be occasional
        inaccuracies or outdated material. We provide general information for informational purposes
        and it should not be taken as professional advice.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p class="mt-4">
      <strong>No warranties:</strong> We expressly disclaim any and all implied warranties, including
      but not limited to the <strong
        >implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, and
        non-infringement</strong
      >. We also disclaim any warranties arising out of course of dealing or usage of trade.
    </p>

    <p class="mt-4">
      For example, we do not warrant that using our website will increase your knowledge or that
      participating in our programs will guarantee success of your project. Any reliance you place
      on the information on our Services is strictly at your own risk.
    </p>

    <p class="mt-4">
      <strong>Exception:</strong> Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties.
      If those laws apply to you, some of the above exclusions may not apply to you to the extent prohibited
      by law. In such cases, our warranties are limited to the minimum extent permitted by law.

        >To the fullest extent permitted by law, Tech for Palestine and its officers, directors,
        employees, volunteers, agents, partners, and affiliates (collectively, the "Released

      >, and whether or not we have been informed of the possibility of such damages.
    </p>

    <p class="mt-4">
      This limitation of liability includes, for example, any damages resulting from:
    </p>

    <ul class="mt-4 list-disc space-y-2 pl-6">
      <li>Your use of or reliance on any content or information obtained through the Services;</li>
      <li>Unauthorized access to or alteration of your transmissions or data;</li>

    <p class="mt-4">
      <strong>Cap on Liability:</strong> To the extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall

        >$100 USD</strong
      >, or (b) the total amount of fees (if any) you paid to us for use of the Services in the 6
      months prior to the claim. This limitation applies even if any limited remedy specified in
      these Terms is found to have failed its essential purpose.
    </p>

    <p class="mt-4">
      <strong>Nature of claims:</strong> The limitations above apply to all types of claims, whether
      arising from breach of contract, breach of warranty, tort (including negligence), product liability,

    <p class="mt-4">
      <strong>No Liability for User Conduct or Third Parties:</strong> You specifically acknowledge that
      we are not liable for the defamatory, offensive, or illegal conduct of <strong

    <p class="mt-4">
      <strong>Exceptions:</strong> Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of certain
      damages. If laws of such a jurisdiction apply to you, some or all of the above exclusions or limitations

      prior written consent of Tech for Palestine. We will use reasonable efforts to notify you of
      any such claim, action, or proceeding upon becoming aware of it.

    <p class="mt-4">
      This indemnification obligation shall survive any termination of your account or of the

      12. General Provisions
    </h2>

    <p>
      <strong>12.1 Governing Law:</strong> These Terms and any dispute arising out of or relating to
      these Terms or the Services will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the
      <strong>State of Georgia, USA</strong>, without giving effect to any conflict of laws
      principles that would cause the laws of another jurisdiction to apply. If you live outside the
      United States, you understand and agree that U.S. laws shall apply to the maximum extent
      permitted, and that our Services are intended to be compliant with U.S. laws (including
      privacy, accessibility, etc.) primarily.
    </p>

    <p class="mt-4">
      <strong>12.2 Jurisdiction and Venue:</strong> Subject to applicable law, you and Tech for Palestine
      agree that any judicial proceeding to resolve claims relating to these Terms or the Services will
      be brought <strong>in the federal or state courts</strong> located in <strong>Georgia</strong
      >, unless such jurisdiction is prohibited by law. Both you and Tech for Palestine consent to
      venue and personal jurisdiction in such courts, except where prohibited by applicable law. We
      both agree to waive any objections to the exercise of jurisdiction over us by these courts and
      to venue in these courts, including any claim that such legal action has been brought in an
      inconvenient forum, to the extent permitted by law.
    </p>

    <p class="mt-4">
      However, we reserve the right to seek injunctive or equitable relief in any jurisdiction to
      protect our intellectual property or confidential information.
    </p>

    <p class="mt-4">
      <strong>12.3 Alternative Dispute Resolution:</strong> Both parties are free to seek an amicable
      resolution of any dispute. You agree to try to resolve any dispute informally by contacting us
      first. If we cannot resolve a dispute informally, the above litigation provisions apply.
    </p>

    <p class="mt-4">
      <strong>12.4 No Class Actions:</strong> To the extent permitted by law, you and Tech for Palestine
      agree that <strong
        >each may bring claims against the other only in an individual capacity</strong
      > and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative action. Unless
      both you and Tech for Palestine agree, no arbitrator or judge may consolidate more than one person's
      claims or otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.
    </p>

    <p class="mt-4">
      <strong>12.5 No Waiver:</strong> Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these
      Terms shall not operate as a waiver of such right or provision. No waiver by Tech for Palestine
      of any term or condition set forth in these Terms shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver
      of such term or condition or a waiver of any other term or condition, and any failure of Tech for
      Palestine to assert a right or provision under these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such
      right or provision.
    </p>

    <p class="mt-4">
      <strong>12.6 Severability:</strong> If any provision of these Terms is held by a court of competent
      jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable for any reason, that provision shall be eliminated
      or limited to the minimum extent such that the remaining provisions of the Terms will continue
      in full force and effect. In other words, the invalid part will be modified or severed, but the
      rest of the Terms will remain valid and enforceable.
    </p>

    <p class="mt-4">
      <strong>12.7 Entire Agreement:</strong> These Terms, together with our Privacy Policy and any supplemental
      terms or agreements expressly incorporated by reference, constitute the <strong

      understandings, agreements, representations, and warranties, both written and oral, regarding the
      Services. You acknowledge that you have not relied on any prior or contemporaneous representations
      not explicitly set forth in these Terms.
    </p>

    <p class="mt-4">
      <strong>12.8 Assignment:</strong> You may not assign or transfer any of your rights or obligations
      under these Terms without our prior written consent. We may assign our rights and obligations to
      an affiliate or in connection with a merger, acquisition, sale of assets, or by operation of law
      or otherwise. These Terms will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors,
      and permitted assigns.
    </p>

    <p class="mt-4">
      <strong>12.9 Relationship of Parties:</strong> These Terms do not create any agency, partnership,
      joint venture, or employment relationship between you and Tech for Palestine. You and we are independent
      contractors. You have no authority to make or accept any offers or representations on behalf of
      Tech for Palestine. You agree not to hold yourself out as an employee, agent, or representative
      of Tech for Palestine.
    </p>

    <p class="mt-4">
      <strong>12.10 Force Majeure:</strong> Tech for Palestine will not be liable for any failure or
      delay in performance of its obligations (except payment obligations, if any) under these Terms
      if such failure or delay is caused by circumstances beyond our reasonable control, including but
      not limited to acts of God, war, terrorism, civil unrest, strikes or other labor disputes, government
      actions, pandemics, power or internet outages, or other similar events.
    </p>

    <p class="mt-4">
      <strong>12.11 Notices:</strong> We may provide notices or communications to you via email (to the
      address associated with your account, if you have one), via written communication sent by first
      class mail or pre-paid post to your address on record (if we have it), by posting on our website,
      or through other reasonable means. You are responsible for keeping your contact information up-to-date.
      Official notices to us should be sent to our contact address in the "Contact Us" section below,
      preferably with a copy via email.

      <strong>12.12 Export Controls:</strong> If you are accessing our Services from outside the United
      States, you do so on your own initiative and are responsible for compliance with local laws. You
      agree to comply with all applicable export and re-export control laws and regulations, including
      those of the U.S. Department of Commerce and other U.S. agencies and authorities, and not to transfer,
      by electronic transmission or otherwise, any content or software subject to restrictions under
      such laws to a national or destination prohibited by such laws.
    </p>

    <p class="mt-4">
      <strong>12.13 Updates to Terms:</strong> Just as we may update our Privacy Policy, we may also
      occasionally update these Terms. If we make material changes, we will notify users (for example,
      by posting the updated Terms with a new effective date on our site, and/or by email notification
      to account holders). Your continued use of the Services after the Terms have been updated will
      constitute acceptance of the revised Terms. If you do not agree to the new terms, you should stop
      using the Services.
