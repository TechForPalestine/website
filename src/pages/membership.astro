            <p class="text-lg leading-8 text-gray-700">
              Dues help us progress towards our goal of 10,000 projects for Palestine by supporting
              project work itself: grants for advocacy projects, accessing experts to provide
              trainings, hosting networking and learning events, etc. - and by supporting the
              infrastructure that lets us get work done, such as paying for software and employees.
