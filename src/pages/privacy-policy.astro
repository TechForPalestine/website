    <h3 class="mb-3 mt-6 text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900">Information from Third Parties</h3>

    <p>We may receive information about you from third-party sources in certain situations:</p>

    <ul class="mt-4 list-disc space-y-2 pl-6">
      <li>
        <strong>Service Providers:</strong> For example, if we use an email newsletter platform or a

        opened our email or completed a form).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Social Media or Linked Services:</strong> If you engage with our organization on social
        media platforms (like following our page or tagging us), or if our website includes social media
        plugins, those platforms may share limited information with us according to their policies (for
        instance, your public profile information).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Partner Organizations:</strong> We may obtain information from partner nonprofits or
        collaborators (e.g. if you were referred to our incubator by a partner, or if we run a joint
        event and they share attendee info). We will handle such data according to this Policy.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Public Sources:</strong> We might collect information from publicly available sources
        for outreach or research (for example, if we compile a list of tech entrepreneurs in a region
        via public records).
      </li>

      We treat any personal information obtained from third parties in line with the practices

      encourage you to review their policies as well.

      How We Use Your Information
    </h2>

    <p>
      We use personal information for purposes consistent with our nonprofit mission and as
      necessary to provide our Services. The purposes for which we <strong>process</strong> (collect,
      store, use, or share) personal information include:
    </p>

    <ul class="mt-4 list-disc space-y-2 pl-6">
      <li>
        <strong>Providing and Improving Services:</strong> To operate and maintain our website, applications,
        and programs. For example, we use personal data to process volunteer registrations, evaluate
        incubator project applications, and facilitate project incubator activities. We may use data
        to personalize your experience and develop new features or services.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Communication:</strong> To communicate with you about your involvement or interest in
        our organization. This includes responding to inquiries you send us, sending confirmations or
        updates related to volunteering or project applications, and notifying you of important changes
        or information about our Services.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Email Newsletters and Updates:</strong> If you join our mailing list or otherwise opt
        in, to send you newsletters, announcements about our activities and progress toward our mission,
        event invitations, or fundraising appeals. (You will always have the opportunity to opt out of
        such communications, as described in <a
          href="#your-privacy-rights"
          class="text-green-700 hover:text-green-800">"Your Privacy Rights"</a
        >.)
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Volunteer and Donor Management:</strong> To manage volunteer assignments or donor relationships
        (if applicable). For instance, we might use your data to track volunteer hours or to send donation
        receipts and thank-you letters.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Incubator Program Support:</strong> For accepted projects in our incubator, to provide
        services such as mentorship, access to resources, and tracking of project progress. We use project
        team members' information to coordinate support and facilitate collaboration via our app or other
        channels.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Analytics and Improvements:</strong> To analyze usage of our website and app, so we can
        understand how users engage with our Services. This helps us troubleshoot issues, secure our
        systems, and make informed decisions about improvements or new features. (For example, we might
        analyze which website pages are most visited or gather aggregate statistics on volunteer sign-ups
        per month.)
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Legal and Security:</strong> To protect the rights and safety of our organization, our
        users, or others. We may use information to detect, prevent, and respond to fraud, abuse, security
        incidents, and other harmful activity. We also may use data as needed to comply with applicable
        laws and regulations or to exercise legal rights.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Record-Keeping:</strong> To maintain proper organizational records for administrative
        purposes. For example, we may keep records of volunteer agreements, consent forms, or correspondence.
        This also includes fulfilling any record retention requirements (such as tax records for donations,
        if any).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Other Purposes with Consent:</strong> If we intend to use your information for a purpose
        not described above, we will explain it at the time of collection and, if required by law, obtain
        your consent.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p class="mt-4">
      We will not use personal information for purposes that are incompatible with the above, unless
      we obtain your consent or as permitted/required by law. Under most privacy laws, we are not
      allowed to <em>materially</em> change the purposes for processing your data without updating you
      and obtaining necessary consent. If we ever need to use your data for a new purpose, we will notify
      you and, if required, seek your permission.

      How We Share Your Information
    </h2>

    <p>
      We understand the importance of your privacy. We <strong>do not sell</strong> your personal information
      to third parties for profit or monetary gain. We only share or disclose personal data in the following
      circumstances:
    </p>

    <ul class="mt-4 list-disc space-y-2 pl-6">
      <li>
        <strong>Service Providers:</strong> We may share information with third-party service providers
        and vendors who perform services on our behalf. This includes, for example, website hosting companies,
        cloud storage providers, email newsletter platforms, volunteer management databases, or payment/donation
        processors. These service providers are given access only to the information necessary for them
        to perform their functions, and they are contractually obligated to protect it and use it only
        for our authorized purposes.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Partner Organizations and Incubator Advisors:</strong> If you are accepted into our incubator
        program, we might share relevant information about you or your project with mentors, advisors,
        or partner organizations who are collaborating in the program. This is done strictly to further
        the support of your project and only with your consent or under strict confidentiality agreements.
        All such partners are expected to safeguard your information and use it only for program purposes.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Legal Compliance and Protection:</strong> We may disclose information if we believe in
        good faith that such action is necessary to (a) comply with a legal obligation, law or regulation,
        or in response to a valid court order, subpoena, or government request; (b) protect and defend
        our rights or property, or the rights, property, or safety of others; (c) investigate or assist
        in preventing any violation of law or this Privacy Policy or our Terms of Service; or (d) protect
        the personal safety of users or the public.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Organizational Transfers:</strong> As a nonprofit, we do not have "owners" or shareholders.
        However, in the unlikely event of a major organizational change (such as a merger with another
        nonprofit, acquisition of our assets, or reorganization), personal information may be transferred
        to the successor entity. In such a case, your information would remain subject to the promises
        made in this Privacy Policy (unless you're notified otherwise and, if required, consent is obtained).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>With Your Consent:</strong> We may share your personal information for other purposes
        if you ask us to or explicitly consent to such sharing. For example, if we ever want to publish
        a testimonial or success story featuring you, we would seek your consent before doing so.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Aggregated or De-Identified Data:</strong> We may share information that has been aggregated
        (combined with other data so it no longer relates to an identifiable individual) or de-identified
        (stripped of personal identifiers). For instance, we might publish reports showing total number
        of volunteers or general demographic trends. Such information <strong
          >cannot be linked back to you</strong
        > and is not considered personal data.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p class="mt-4">
      Importantly, <strong
        >we do not share personal information with third parties for their own marketing or
        advertising purposes without your consent</strong
      >. In other words, we will not give or sell your name or contact information to other
      organizations so they can market to you, unless you agree or request it. California residents
      have the right to be informed about our practices in this regard – we confirm that we do <em
        >not</em
      > disclose personal information to unaffiliated third parties for those parties' direct marketing
      purposes without consent.
    </p>

    <p class="mt-4">
      Additionally, we do <strong>not</strong> "sell" or "share" personal information as those terms
      are defined under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) (i.e., we do not exchange personal
      data for money or other valuable consideration, nor do we share it for cross-context behavioral
      advertising). Since we do not sell or share personal data in that manner, there is no need for
      you to "opt-out" of sales – we have no such activity by default. If this ever changes, we will
      update this policy and provide appropriate opt-out mechanisms.

      Cookies and Tracking Technologies
    </h2>

    <p>
      Like most websites and apps, we use cookies and similar tracking technologies to provide and
      improve our Services. Cookies are small text files that websites save to your browser, which
      allow the site to remember your preferences or recognize your device on subsequent visits. We
      use cookies for several reasons:
    </p>

    <ul class="mt-4 list-disc space-y-2 pl-6">
      <li>
        <strong>Essential Cookies:</strong> Some cookies are necessary for our site to function properly
        (for example, to keep you logged in to the incubator portal, or to remember your preferences).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Analytics Cookies:</strong> We use third-party analytics tools (such as Google Analytics)
        that set cookies to collect information about how users navigate our site. This helps us understand
        which pages are popular, how users are finding our site, and other usage statistics. We use this
        information in aggregate form to make our website better and more user-friendly.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Functional Cookies:</strong> These cookies remember choices you make (such as your language
        or region, if applicable) and enhance your experience.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Third-Party and Social Media Cookies:</strong> If our site integrates content from third
        parties (for example, an embedded video or social media share button), those providers may set
        cookies. We do not control these cookies; they are governed by the privacy policies of the third
        parties.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p class="mt-4">
      <strong>Your choices:</strong> On your first visit to our website, you may see a cookies notice
      or banner (if required by law in your jurisdiction, such as in the EU). You can consent to or reject
      non-essential cookies as indicated. Additionally, you can manage cookies through your browser settings.
      Most web browsers allow you to refuse new cookies, remove existing cookies, or notify you when
      new cookies are set. Please note that if you block or delete cookies, some features of our Services
      (especially the incubator app login or preferences) may not work properly.
    </p>

    <p class="mt-4">
      We currently do not use technologies like web beacons or pixels in our emails, except as part
      of standard analytics (for instance, our email service might tell us if you opened an email
      newsletter). We do not use online advertising networks or behavioral advertising at this time,
      so you should not see third-party ads on our site that track you.

    <h2 class="mb-4 mt-8 text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900" id="data-security">Data Security</h2>

    <p>
      We take data security seriously and have implemented <strong
        >reasonable security measures</strong
      > to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.
      These measures include technical, administrative, and physical safeguards appropriate to the sensitivity
      of the information. For example, our website uses HTTPS encryption to secure data in transit, and
      we restrict access to personal data to staff or volunteers who need it to perform their duties.
    </p>

    <p class="mt-4">
      However, please understand that <strong
        >no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% secure</strong
      >. While we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee absolute
      security. You use our Services and provide information at your own risk. In the event of a
      data breach that affects your personal information, we will notify you and the appropriate
      authorities as required by law.
    </p>

    <p class="mt-4">
      We also encourage you to take steps to protect your own information. This includes choosing a
      strong password for any account in our incubator app, keeping your login credentials
      confidential, and notifying us immediately if you suspect any unauthorized access to your
      account or information.
    </p>

    <h2 class="mb-4 mt-8 text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900" id="data-retention">
      Data Retention
    </h2>

    <p>
      We will retain your personal information only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes
      we collected it for, including to satisfy any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.
    </p>

    <ul class="mt-4 list-disc space-y-2 pl-6">
      <li>
        <strong>Active Use:</strong> Information you provide (e.g. as a volunteer or program participant)
        will be kept for as long as you are active with our organization and using our Services. For
        example, if you are part of an ongoing project in the incubator, we will retain your account
        information throughout the project's duration.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Mailing List:</strong> If you subscribe to our newsletter, we will retain your email
        address and related preferences until you unsubscribe or ask us to delete that information.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Applications and Records:</strong> If you submit a project application that is not accepted,
        we may keep the information only as long as necessary for legitimate nonprofit purposes or legal
        compliance, unless you request deletion (subject to our legal obligations and technical feasibility).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Legal Obligations:</strong> We may need to retain certain data for longer periods if
        required by applicable law. For example, if you make a donation, we might retain transaction
        records for 7 years for tax and audit purposes. Similarly, if there is a legal dispute or enforcement
        of our Terms, we would keep relevant information until it is resolved and for a period thereafter
        as required or prudent.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Backup and Archival:</strong> Even after you delete information or close your account,
        copies of your data may remain in our backups or archives (which are not in active use) for a
        brief period until those backups are cycled out or deleted. We aim to incorporate secure deletion
        practices where possible.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p class="mt-4">
      When we have no ongoing legitimate need to process your personal information, we will either
      delete it or anonymize it (so it can no longer be associated with you), or if
      deletion/anonymization is not feasible (for example, because the data is stored in secure
      backups), we will securely store the data and isolate it from further use until deletion is
      possible.

      Your Privacy Rights
    </h2>

    <p>
      Depending on your jurisdiction (where you live), you may have certain legal rights regarding
      your personal information. We strive to honor these rights and provide transparency and
      control to all our users. Below is an overview of rights that may be available and how you can
      exercise them:
    </p>

    <h3 class="mb-3 mt-6 text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900">General Rights for All Users</h3>

    <p>All users of our Services can exercise the following controls:</p>

    <ul class="mt-4 list-disc space-y-2 pl-6">
      <li>
        <strong>Access and Update:</strong> You have the right to request access to the personal information
        we hold about you and to receive an explanation of how we use it and who we share it with. You
        may also request correction or updates to your information if it is inaccurate or incomplete.
        For example, if you have an account on our incubator app, you can log in and update certain profile
        information directly. Otherwise, you can contact us to request updates or corrections.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Deletion:</strong> You can ask us to delete your personal information. We will honor
        deletion requests to the extent required by law and technically feasible. For example, if you
        no longer want us to hold your data, you may request that we remove it from our systems. Do note
        there may be exceptions – we might retain certain information for legal compliance, backup systems,
        or internal purposes (see Data Retention above). We will inform you if any such exception applies.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Objection to Processing:</strong> If we process your information based on our legitimate
        interests (or those of a third party), you can object to that processing if you feel it impacts
        your fundamental rights and freedoms. In some cases, we may have compelling legitimate grounds
        to continue processing (or a legal obligation), but we will consider and respond to your request.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Opt-Out of Marketing:</strong> If at any time you prefer not to receive our newsletter
        or other marketing emails, you have the right to opt out. You can do so by clicking the "unsubscribe"
        link in any promotional email, or by contacting us at our email address requesting removal. Once
        we process your opt-out request, we will stop sending you non-transactional communications. (Please
        note that even if you opt out of marketing, we may still send you transactional or relationship
        messages, such as confirmations of volunteering activities, updates on a project you're involved
        in, or important notices about our Services.)
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Consent Withdrawal:</strong> If we are processing your personal information based on
        your consent, you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time. The withdrawal of consent
        will not affect processing already carried out, but will stop future processing.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Non-Discrimination:</strong> We will not discriminate against you for exercising any
        of these rights.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p class="mt-4">
      To exercise any of the above rights, please see the "Contact Us" section at the end of this
      policy. We may need to verify your identity before fulfilling certain requests (to ensure we
      don't modify or disclose data to the wrong person). We will respond to your request within a
      reasonable timeframe and in accordance with applicable law.

      Changes to this Privacy Policy
    </h2>

    <p>
      We may update or revise this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our
      practices, technologies, legal requirements, or for other reasons. When we do, we will change
      the "Last updated" date at the top of this Policy. The updated Privacy Policy will be
      effective as of the time of posting, or a later date if explicitly stated. We encourage you to
      review this page periodically for the latest information on our privacy practices.
    </p>

    <p class="mt-4">
      If we make any <strong>material changes</strong> to this Privacy Policy (for example, if we start
      collecting new types of personal data or significantly change how we use it), we will provide a
      more prominent notice of the change. This might include posting a notice on our website or, if
      appropriate, contacting you via email or other communication. We will comply with any legal requirements
      regarding notice or consent for changes. Your continued use of the Services after any changes indicates
      your acknowledgment of the updated Privacy Policy.
